Simplify SQL Server documentation

## Overview
The basic idea is something like SQLPowerDoc, but focused more on retrieving data into PowerShell data structures (allowing for
easier export into whatever format is desired (CSV, HTML, XLXS, the RDBMS of choice, Confluence and so forth) and focused less on
server discovery (which I feel should be the responsibility of some other tool) and the formatting of the data.

And no use of GZ files. I never understood that choice.

The main driver of this is that the SQL PowerDoc code that I've been using since I downloaded it from CodePlex isn't as stable as I'd like
and doesn't give me the format(s) that I want. There are few forks of SQL PowerDoc on Github, but none seem to be actively developed and,
even if they are, it still isn't _quite_ what I want.

Plus, I'd like to have a "fully fledged" GitHub project, with a "devops" pipeline and all the trimmings.
## Installation
Eventually, I hope to wire this into the well-established GitHub/PSGallery scheme.
